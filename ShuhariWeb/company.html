            Tim Isenman was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, USA. His career began in 2010, when he received a personal invitation from
            Cult Classic filmmaker, Kevin Smith, to work with him on his then upcoming thriller, "Red State". After "Red State", Tim was invited to work
            on the pre-Production of Fox's science education show "Cosmos: A Space Odyssey".
            </br></br>
            Early in 2010, Tim was given the opportunity to work in the video game industry, and started working at <b><a class="link white-80 hover-gold" href="https://riotgames.com">Riot Games, Inc.</a></b>, in Los Angeles,
            initially as a Facilities Assistant Temp, which meant work was cleaning kitchen, building furniture, stocking coffee, and delivering food, among other things.
            Riot eventually created a full-time position for Tim in this role - the first of its kind - and later allowed him to the game development team as a Producer
            on League of Legends. The was the co-manager of League of Legend's Online Store, which was the gateway for billions of dollars of revenue from around the world.
            Tim then became responsible for teams that built some of League of Legend's critical infrustructure for Social gameplay, teams that designed and sold in-game content
            to players around the world that generated revenue on its own in the many millions. Tim's final role at Riot was that of stewarding the game's global "up-time",
            its availability and stability on servers for people to play games with other players. His specific role was managing the game as it existed in China, partnering
            with China internet giant, Tencent. Tencent would go on to acquire Riot Games.
            </br></br>
            After Tencent's acquisition of Riot, Tim moved to Silicon Valley to try out a career in Venture Capitalism, which didn't last for more than a few months.
            Tim quickly decided to continue working as a product developer, and worked at several small startups as a product manager before taking a sabbatical, teaching himself
            programming, and joining Asteroid Technologies in San Francisco to be an engineer on Asteroid's Augmented Reality application editor.
            </br></br>
            To fulfill his lifelong calling of living and making technology in Japan, Tim founded SHUHARI to give Japan truly great products, based on everything he knows about art,
            entertainment, design, and technology to the people of Japan, and the culture that has long held the most influence over his life.
